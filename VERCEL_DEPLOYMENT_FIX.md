# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## The Problem
You're getting "❌ Analysis Failed - Failed to fetch" because:

1. **No Backend Deployed**: Your frontend is trying to connect to a backend that doesn't exist
2. **Placeholder URLs**: Your configuration has placeholder URLs instead of real ones
3. **CORS Issues**: Backend doesn't allow requests from your Vercel domain

## The Solution

### Step 1: Deploy Your Backend First

You need to deploy your backend to a platform like Heroku, Railway, or Render. Here's how:

#### Option A: Deploy to Heroku (Recommended)

1. **Install Heroku CLI** and login
2. **Navigate to backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
3. **Create Heroku app**:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name-here
   ```
4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy backend"
   git push heroku main
   ```
5. **Note your backend URL**: `https://your-app-name-here.herokuapp.com`

#### Option B: Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select the `backend` folder
4. Deploy automatically
5. Note your backend URL

### Step 2: Update Vercel Environment Variables

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Go to Settings → Environment Variables**
3. **Add new variable**:
   - **Name**: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-backend-url.herokuapp.com` (use your actual backend URL)
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development

### Step 3: Redeploy Frontend

1. **Trigger a new deployment** in Vercel (push a commit or manually redeploy)
2. **Wait for deployment to complete**

### Step 4: Test

1. **Visit your Vercel URL**
2. **Upload a resume**
3. **Check browser console** for the debug log showing the API URL being used

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: Vercel configuration (removed placeholder URLs)
✅ **Fixed**: CORS settings (added Vercel domain support)
✅ **Fixed**: Added debug logging to frontend
⏳ **Pending**: You need to deploy your backend and set the environment variable

## Quick Test

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check browser console** when you upload a file
2. **Look for**: "Using API URL: [your-backend-url]"
3. **If you see**: "Using API URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000" - you need to set the environment variable
4. **If you see**: "Using API URL: https://your-backend.herokuapp.com" - the configuration is correct

## Alternative: Use a Mock Backend for Testing

If you want to test the frontend without deploying a backend, you can temporarily modify the frontend to show a mock response:

```javascript
// In App.js, replace the fetch call with:
const mockResponse = {
  score: 85,
  feedback: "Great resume! Well structured with good keyword usage.",
  detailed_scores: {
    completeness: 90,
    keyword_score: 80,
    length_score: 85
  },
  word_count: 650,
  keywords_found: 12,
  total_keywords: 15
};
setResult(mockResponse);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy your backend** using one of the options above
2. **Set the environment variable** in Vercel
3. **Redeploy your frontend**
4. **Test the full flow**

The "Failed to fetch" error will be resolved once you have a working backend deployed and properly configured!
